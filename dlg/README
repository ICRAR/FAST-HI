 * Run the start_procs.sh script. That will start all required background
   processes that are required by DALiuGE.
 * Open your browser at localhost:8001 to see the web UI.
 * Run the submit_demo_graph.sh script. That will send the demo graph to the
   DALiuGE processes and run it. You should see the web UI update itself.
