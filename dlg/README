To run the pipeline:

 * Run the start_procs.sh script. That will start all required background
   processes that are required by DALiuGE.
   * Run with the -A option to bind the processes to all network interfaces
 * Open your browser at localhost:8001 to see the web UI.
 * Run the submit_demo_graph.sh script. That will send the demo graph to the
   DALiuGE processes and run it. You should see the web UI update itself.
   * Use the -d and -c options to specify the root directory where data will be
     found, and where the configuration files can be found, respectivelly.
 * Run the stop_procs.sh script to stop all background processes.

To edit the logical graph:

 * Run the start_lg_editor.sh script.
 * Open your browser at localhost:8084
 * Edit and save
 * When finished, just stop the start_lg_editor.sh script with Ctrl-C
